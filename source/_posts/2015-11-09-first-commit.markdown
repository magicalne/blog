Damn...
Finally finish setting up my new blog on github page with [jekyll][jekyll-gh]. Never thought it would be that hard.
The version of ruby is like a hell...
The source which is in GemFile CANNOT use https, and use https instead... I manually installed dependenies during "bundle install", a lot...

I will leave the layout today. Redesign it in this weekend.
Tough night. See you, ME...
